# What was it like to attend PyCon Korea 2019

On August 17-18, 2019, I attended the Python Conference in Korea. What was it like?

### 1.	Convenient location - the venue: COEX
COEX is one of the most well-known venues in Korea. Located near Gangnam (yes, this is the Gangnam from the song, Gangnam Style by Psy), the venue is connected to Samsung subway station and is easily accessible. It is a bit far, about 30 minutes away from the most famous tourist area, Myoungdong. But Myoungdong is old anyways. I would say you take this chance to try out Gangnam. Plus there is a huge shopping mall inside COEX – fun to roam around especially when the weather outside is not so great.  

### 2.	Inspiring sessions 
The sessions were fun and inspiring. One of the presenters said “You might ask why I did this in Python (not in other more commonly used languages for that purpose). I did it simply because It could be done in Python.” This statement seemed to capture the whimsical, ballsy attitude of the day in general. My favorite session was “Debugging law” by Jaeyoon Kim. He presented law making was just like programming, going on for 70 years by hundreds of people each working on small section of code. He used BeautifulSoup and Pandas to crawl and debug laws, looking for mismatch in reference, to analyze punishment trends, and to show graphic representation of networking among laws. Super fun to watch how people use Python to extend their horizon and discover more. Isn’t this a testament to Guido’s statement, **“computer programming for everbody”**? 
 
### 3.	Striving for accessibility 
PyCon CoC was visible everywhere. I received emails in advance on wheelchair accessibility directions. Realtime captioning was provided. Childcare was available. Thanks everyone who made this happen. Though there were a few, more female presenters and participants would have been great.  

## My takeaway?
- **Static vs. Dynamic language**
I felt weirdly more comfortable in Java. Java, being the static language, comes across more straight forward to me. It was good to know that this was a common phenomenon and I wasn’t the only weird one. 
- **Garbage collection**
Python’s automatic garbage collection and its limitations were often brought up. 
- **Anti-pattern**
What a fancy word of the day. Used gracefully, this word could so make you look like you know what you are talking about even when you totally don’t. lol. Love it. 

#### Totally worth the ticket price KRW 77,000.
